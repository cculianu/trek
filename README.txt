Unix System V Star Trek Game

Original Author: Curt Olson <curt@sledge.mn.org>

Modernized by: Calin Culianu <calin.culianu@gmail.com>

This codebase originally appeared on Unix System V back in the 1980s, I
believe. It used K&R C and other assorted things that don't work anymore
on modern C compilers. The code has been modernized to compile on modern
compilers, and various bugs have been fixed by me, Calin, in June 2024.

The code was downloaded from:
https://web.archive.org/web/20070319134345/http://www.dunnington.u-net.com/public/startrek/trek.tar.gz

The above is an archive of an updated version of the original SysV Unix
code, modified by the author to compile on (at the time) modern systems,
but it's still from the 1990s and still didn't compile on modern C 
compilers.

As such, I did modify this code to work and to fix bugs and to make it
more portable.

If you want to see the original SysV Unix code, it can be obtained at
this repository:

Note that the above very old code does not compile on modern systems without some
significant modification -- you're better off just using the code in this repository 
if you wish to actually play the game.
